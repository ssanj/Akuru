1. Better array support. Something of the sort: [F[_] <: Traversable[_], T <: DomainObject](value:F[T])
2. Handle nulls in getElement
3. Created NestedFields for nested objects
4. allow equality between 2 Fields and 2 FieldValues
5. Get rid of imports from MongoTypes.MongoObject._
6. Convert regex to Scala RegEx.
7. Add Command Objects to run any JSon command
8. Allow saving of multiple DomainObjects at once. save (list) ~~>
9. MongoWriteResult should only return Boolean. true if valid false if not. The users function should be safe (runWithEither[Option[String], Boolean]
10. Find a way to not have to type in idField for each DomainObject
11. Clean up unnecessary methods on MongoObjectBehaviour
12. create example from Casbah
13. Write support and scenarios for similar to Numeric Operators:
    $pull : { field : {$gt: 3} } } removes array elements greater than 3 (could not get this to work in the console)
    $pull : { field : {<match-criteria>} } removes array elements meeting match criteria
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. find one has an onError clause while find many does not (done  by unifying findOne and findMany)
2. update many does not exist (done)
3. renamed update operations to include $: $set, $put, $push etc (done)
4. Get rid of Splat for arrays. Arrays should work as per everything else (done)
5. Are Query objects needed? (done)
6. Clean up update operator syntax. (set (field === value) and set (field2 === value2)) is ugly.
 (done - we can now do set(field1 === value1 & field2 === value2)
7. update one/many have an unnecessary returnErrors clause. Remove. (done. we need this.)
8. Make Order subdsl better. Current Order(field1, ASC|DSC) -> OrderBy field1 | ASC (done. We can now use field1 -> ASC)
9. make field search type safe on the owner object. (done)
10. Rename and2 in FieldValueJoiner (done)
11. simplify FieldValueJoiner to one class. (done)
12. Migrate find one, many and update to use FieldValueJoiners. (done)
13. Make Regex typesafe. (done for find one, find many, update) (done)
14. Remove ?* syntax for regex. (done)
15. Make set() type-safe MongoUpdateObject needs a type of O <: DomainObject. (done)
16. Make Order method type-safe. (done)
17. Do we need find one and many? Can't we used find (many returned by default) (done)
18. Unifiy update|updsert|findModifyReturn|findModifyDelete|findModifyUpsert (done through update and modify and remove)
19. Make SortObjectJoiner type safe or remove it all together. (done)
20. Order now takes in a list of field and SortOrders. Eg. constrainBy (Order(field1 -> ASC, field2 -> DSC)) (done)
21. Rename FieldValueJoiner to Query (done)
22. Need to use find without (). Eg find (Blog) should be find Blog. (done)
