16. MongoWriteResult should only return Boolean. true if valid false if not. The users function should be safe (runWithEither[Option[String], Boolean]
17. Make Order subdsl better. Current Order(field1, ASC|DSC) -> OrderBy field1 | ASC (done. We can now use field1 -> ASC)
18. Find a way to not have to type in idField for each DomainObject
19. Clean up unnecessary methods on MongoObjectBehaviour
